2. Converts between PREMIS alone and PREMIS in METS in both directions.
3. Describes a file in PREMIS metadata using the DAITSS 2 Description Service

Programming language: Schematron + XSLT + Ruby
Operating system/runtime environment: Any OS that supports these; tested on linux but any flavor of unix should do
Version: 0.2.1.2 (beta)
